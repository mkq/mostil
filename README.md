A mostly tiling window layout manager.

You configure "screens" which are actually arbitrary regions which need not correspond to physical screens, and divide each screen into two tiles. That's the tiling part.
The not so tiling aspect is that screens could also overlap.

Usage: Create an entrypoint script like [mostil-demo.ahk](./mostil-demo.ahk). See that script for further documentation.
